Original data set \- [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## The modified dataset was produced using the following files:

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- â€˜test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

##Modifications

- The test and training sets were reintegrated 
- Activity names and feature names were added in place of numeric labels
- Activity names and feature names were edited for human readability
- Data set was limited to only the measures on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement captured
- Data set was processed to provide the average value of each feature per activity per subject
